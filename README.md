# ðŸš— <strong>rent-a-car</strong> ðŸš—

Car renting and offering app made for a SoftUni Angular course.

## Fully deployed and built using the MEAN stack

# <strong>functionality</strong>

**important**
Only 1 car can be rented at a time by a user, as practically that user must be the intended driver, as well as to avoid possible abuse of the app.
The number of cars one user can offer for rent is not limited.

## Common parts (guest and user):

- lands on home page with short intro and geolocation info to engage the visitor, with calls to action.

- general cars section, where only currently available cars are listed.

- car details vary, based on role - guests can only see the general info, while users can rent or manage the car offer if they own it.

- register and login pages for authentication

## User parts:

- car offer adding page, where the user can select from a large list of brands and models, and fill in the rest of the info

- car offer editing page, accessible through the car details page, where the user can change an offer they have created.

- profile page, where the user can see their personal details: name, email, rented (if any) car, offered (if any) car/s.

# other project info
